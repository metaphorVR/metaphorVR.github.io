**Vesna G. Djokic** is a Marie Curie Sk≈Çodowska postdoctoral fellow at Goldsmiths University of London and visiting researcher at the University of Amsterdam. Her research is in the area of the computational cognitive neuroscience of language. She is specifically interested in how we process and represent more abstract concepts and how we understand figurative language.

**Ekaterina Shutova** is an Assistant Professor at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) at the University of Amsterdam, where she leads the Amsterdam Natural Language Understanding Lab. Her research is in the area of natural language processing, with a specific focus on machine learning for natural language understanding tasks. Her current interests include few-shot learning, joint modelling of language and vision, multilingual NLP and cognitively-motivated models of semantic processing.

**Rebecca Fiebrink** is a Reader at the Creative Computing Institute at University of the Arts London. Her students and research assistants work on a variety of projects developing new technologies to enable new forms of human expression, creativity, and embodied interaction. Much of her current research combines techniques from human-computer interaction, machine learning, and signal processing to allow people to apply machine learning more effectively to new problems, such as the design of new digital musical instruments and gestural interfaces for gaming and accessibility. She is also involved in projects developing rich interactive technologies for digital humanities scholarship, and machine learning education.
